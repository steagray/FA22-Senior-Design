	This project is a two-dimensional role playing game developed in Godot. The outline of the game includes a minimum of 3 different
	levels, a dungeon to explore, an over-world to explore, and tutorial level to introduce the main mechanic. The main mechanic of 
	the game is the player has access to a subset of the four main elements: Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. Whichever elements the
	player has access to at any time can be modified by "techniques" found around the world. These could do a variety of things
	to your chosen elements, such as: AoE (Area of Attack), Rapid Fire, DoT (Damage over time), etc...
	Our stretch goals include adding a secret boss to fight, as well as adding "elemental enemies", or enemy types that
	have limited magical capabilities. Farther stretch goals include add more elements that the player can access for
	variety in overall game-play and added replay value.
