# Project Spellda

Our project is Project Spellda, a two-dimensional, top down role playing game developed in Godot.
Our game will minimally include 3 different levels: a tutorial level to introduce the mechanics of the game, followed by an overworld and dungeon that are intertwined.
At the beginning of the game, the player will choose two of the four in-game elements: Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. 
The player then explores the surrounding area, looking for upgrades to their default spells. 
At any time, the player can dip into the dungeon to test their abilities on the stronger enemies that await them, with the end goal 
being to get to the center of the dungeon and slay the boss. The game is made entirely using Godot's built-in scripting language GDScript.

## Inspirations

We drew from a few different places for inspiration, and each place gave us different ideas on how we wanted to design this game.

First was Zelda (Pictured Above), which really spoke to us when it came to gameplay and map style. We loved the dungeon and overworld
loop, so we made sure to incorporate this in our game.

Next was "Thomas Was Alone" (Again, pictured above), which inspired our simplistic style choices, including keeping
different entities and characters to simple polygons.

The final inspiration pictured above is called Illumine. What we saw in this was beatiful shadow work, which we strived to emulate.


## The Evolution of the Game

At first, this game started off very basic.

Here, the orange "xor" was just a note of plans for the room. This was some of the earliest work done on the project.

In the above picture, you can see the enemy that we had implemented along with a different map. This was a big stride for us, 
and really was a snowball point for the project.

And this is our game now. We achieved the beautiful shadow work we wanted, as well as cleaning up the tilework and adding variety and new areas to explore
in the game.
